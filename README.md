This template builds [Pimcore v10](https://pimcore.com/) on [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/). It comes pre-installed with a MariaDB database and Redis for caching via a custom configuration file. It will self-install on the first deploy.

Pimcore is a Symfony-based Digital Experience Platform.

## Features

-   PHP 8.1
-   MariaDB 10.4
-   Redis 5
-   Automatic TLS certificates
-   Composer-based build

## Post-install

1. This template installs Pimcore with a default `admin` user with password `admin`. **You must login and change this immediately.**

2. Once the site has been installed and the password changed, you may optionally modify the `deploy` hook in `.platform.app.yaml` and remove the install block. It's the part wrapped in a bash `if` statement that includes the default user and password.

## Customizations

The following changes have been made relative to a vanilla Pimcore install. If using this project as a reference for your own existing project, replicate the changes below to your project.

-   The `.platform.app.yaml`, `.platform/services.yaml`, and `.platform/routes.yaml` files have been added.These provide Platform.sh-specific configuration and are present in all projects on Platform.sh. You may customize them as you see fit.
-   An additional Composer library, [`platformsh/config-reader`](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-php), has been added. It provides convenience wrappers for accessing the Platform.sh environment variables.
-   The Doctrine ORM has been included out of the box.
-   [`config.yml`](/app/config/config.yml) - At the top of this file in the `imports` section, a new resource is added named `parameters_platformsh.php`. That will load a PHP file rather than YAML file to specify Pimcore configuration parameters. It also enables Doctrine and Redis caching. Due to a bug in Doctrine, the database version must be specified explicitly in `config.yml` or this project will fail to deploy. It is already set. Remember to update this file if you change the database version used in `config.yaml`.
-   [`parameters_platformsh.php`](/app/config/parameters_platformsh.php) - This file contains Platform.sh-specific code to map environment variables into Symfony parameters. This file will be parsed on every page load. By default it only maps a default database and Redis connection parameters. You can add to it as needed.
-   [`installer.yml`](/app/config/installer.yml) - This file is modified so the install process can retrieve the database connection parameters.
